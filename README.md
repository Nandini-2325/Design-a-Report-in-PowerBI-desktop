## 🧪 Lab Overview
This project demonstrates the **end-to-end process of designing, formatting, and publishing** a multi-page report in **Power BI Desktop**.  
As part of the **Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst (Cloud Slice)** lab series, the focus was on building a professional and interactive report that effectively communicates insights through data visualization.

Throughout this lab, I explored key concepts in:
- Report design and layout best practices  
- Configuring visual fields and formatting options  
- Applying filters, slicers, and drill-down functionalities  
- Publishing and sharing reports via **Power BI Service**

The final report was published online, allowing users to **interact with the visuals, explore data trends**, and experience an intuitive dashboard experience directly in the browser.
