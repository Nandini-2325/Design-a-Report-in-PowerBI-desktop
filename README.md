# Power BI Report Design – Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst (Lab)

This project is part of the **Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst (Cloud Slice)** training series. It demonstrates the process of designing and publishing a **multi-page report** in Power BI Desktop.

## 🧪 Lab Overview
In this lab, I created a **three-page interactive Power BI report**, configuring visual fields, applying formatting properties, and preparing the report for publication.  
The final report is published to the **Power BI Service**, where users can interact with the visuals online.
